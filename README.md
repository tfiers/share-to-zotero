# Zoro: a Zotero client for Android

Status: initial development.

The code is based on the
[recommended Jetpack architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide)
and uses most
[Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture).

If you don't have experience with these (or with Android development in general), I heartily recommend the
[Android Kotlin Fundamentals Codelabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/android-kotlin-fundamentals/),
which I followed before creating this app.
